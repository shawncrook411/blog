## Description
I've created a website that allows you to access it as a blog. You can create posts, make comments on other user's posts, create an acocunt, login and out, and even edit/delete your previous posts and comments!

## Installation
No need to install

## Usage
Access the website from this link: [Link](https://shawncrook411-blog-6fa1df863388.herokuapp.com/). Then from there you may use the on-screen forms to create an account, log in, and post your own comments and posts
